"Renamer" by Albert Bertilsson

This is still 1 of the, if not the best file renamer tool.
Simple. Easy to understand & configure.

Best of all, it was & still is free.

Albert's site has been dead for years but I still have the installer for version 6.0.
I am putting it here because I got tired of searching through CDs & DVDs everytime I
want to install it on a new system.

I hope if he sees this he's not upset, but here it is: renamer60.exe

Installer works in windows enviroment only, x32 & 64.

Does NOT WORK w/ Windows 11
